# Common Installation

This is a general workflow. A resource-specific installation page takes priority whenever its instructions differ.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Extract the download">
    Extract the archive and preserve the intended folder structure. Avoid an extra nested folder created by some archive tools.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Place the resource">
    Move the resource folder into an organized directory beneath your server's `resources` folder.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install confirmed dependencies">
    Use only the dependencies named in the resource's current documentation or included release files.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the resource">
    Edit the included configuration files carefully. Keep a copy of your changes when updating.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the start entry">
    Add the documented `ensure` entry to `server.cfg` after any required dependencies.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart and test">
    Restart the server or resource, inspect the server console, and test expected behavior in a controlled environment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Installation hygiene

- Keep resource folder names unchanged unless the documentation explicitly permits a rename.
- Confirm the server artifact and dependency versions.
- Import SQL only when the release includes a database file and instructs you to use it.
- Check Lua configuration syntax after every edit.
- Test updates away from your production server first.

<Tip>
If a resource does not start, look for the first related console error. Later errors are often consequences of that first failure.
